## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

> 1. In the Hack a Growth mindset video - when she talked about her previous way of thinking when she was in university,
>she felt like when she couldn't do something, that she wasn't cut out for it. I remember feeling this way in my science
>and math classes growing up. I had decent grades, but it didn't feel like the work came naturally, I assumed that any STEM
>career path couldn't be for me.

> 2. Setting S.M.A.R.T. goals = specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound goals.
>Using this to break down large coding projects into manageable sub goals

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
> I demonstrate it now by not getting overly frustrated when I can't get something the first time. If after a couple of minutes >I can't sole my problem, I write down the specific problem to circle back to after I have had a break. I also seek outside >resources such as my cohort classmates.

>I do still struggle with being okay with the exercise problems that are a little beyond what I have already mastered.


1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
> Chickfila App - they most likely used arrays to list out the items in each meal combo

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
> It's a way for us to store a list of related items, as opposed to writing them out in code individually

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
> Loops are used to check a condition. It is how we run a code multiple times without having to type it out manually each time

> We use a loop with an array when we want to run a code through each item in an array

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
> A loop is used to perform a task a certain number of times. Like picking up your toys, if you could only pick up one toy at a time and put it back in your toy chest, this is like running a loop. You are performing the same task until you run out of toys to put back into a toy chest.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
> Array loops was an interesting read. I really liked the videos that were added to this section
> I liked the way the YouTube channel whatsdev" walked me through loop arrays and subscribed to his channel.
