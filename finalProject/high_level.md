##High Level Overview of ceasar_cipher solution:

1) Create a Caesar Cipher function with string and number parameters. You will also be determining the number of letters your Ceasar Cipher will skip to achieve your encoded return.

2) Assign the string and numbers to an array variable. The letters of the alphabet will be logged in this array.

2) Create a loop that takes into account string length. This loop should also create a new variable which assigns your current letter to an index in your String.

* Add your if/else statements, if else statements should address the alphabet length and if it needs to loop, spaces in your string, and if the string index matches your string letter as determined by your shift value.

3) console.log your string to get your new encoded output
