## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
```
I think I'm right in between. It still takes me time to think about using technical terms correctly in my questions, but I am getting better at it.
```

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
```
It was okay. It is still a little unnerving when I see outside resources that utilizes different symbols or syntax than what is in our exercise problems. The videos are what I find most helpful.
```

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
```
A conditional statement is used to evaluate true or false
Daily life conditional example: Deciding if you have enough money to purchase a new item of clothing
Web application example: When you are logging into your online bank account
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
```
You use else if statements to make an if statement more complex
Javascript will run through each line of code until it finds the true statement. It will only execute one block.
```

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
```
logical operators!
```
1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
```
No questions, right now. I had syntax error questions, but I posted these in my FE small group slack channel and got an answer from my classmates.
```
