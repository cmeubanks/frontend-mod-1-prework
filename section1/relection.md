## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  

   >I noticed that I share similar feelings with the writer of the article, particularly being new the industry
   >and a woman. I already have a growth mindset and enjoy teaching concepts to others so that I become better at
   >learning and recalling information.  

   >This article makes me want to read more informative articles related to coding in my spare time, make sure I
   >am eating healthy (Fish, fruits and veggies), and also I remember to take breaks early and often.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.  

1. **number** - positive, negative or decimals. Make sure not to include commas in large numbers.     
2. **string** - represented with "" or '' a letter, character, or number.     
3. **boolean** - true or false data type.   

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?   
var greeting = "Hello World!";  

console.log(greeting);  

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
> I would use // or /* */ to indicate comments in Javascript.  
> A code comment is used to describe what your code is doing. Useful for other developers who may be
> working on a project with you or so you can go back to your code later on.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
> A variable is like putting sticky notes on your fridge. It's a place for the computer to store data so it can remember late on.  

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
> The site I use is google maps. Variable examples most likely used are:  
1. var streetName = "Quail Ridge"; (string)
2. var timeToDestination = 15; (integer)
3. var restaurantOpen = true; (boolean)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
> When you join together different variable types.  

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
> For Google maps, the site operator most likely used a concatentation when giving the directions and driving distance in the same window  

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
> I had an initial question about comments that I pushed out to my Frontend small group for clarification. My code had a syntax error and at the time I had left out the // which threw my entire document of code when I ran it.  
>I wanted to know if my boolean example in question 6 was correct or if this needs to be formatted with a comparison operator to be a valid boolean data type example?
